# TMPS Laboratory Work #1 - Creational Design Patterns

**Author:** Èšugui Artur  
**Group:** FAF-231

---

## Objectives:

- Get familiar with the Creational DPs;
- Choose a specific domain (Restaurant Management);
- Implement at least 3 CDPs for the specific domain;

---

## Used Design Patterns:

- Singleton
- Builder
- Prototype
- Object Pool

---

## Implementation

This project models a restaurant management system using four creational design patterns:

- **Singleton** ensures a single Restaurant instance manages the menu and tables.
- **Builder** constructs complex menu items (e.g., burgers with ingredients) and orders.
- **Prototype** allows cloning and customizing menu items (e.g., making a cheeseburger from a burger).
- **Object Pool** manages a pool of reusable Table objects for dine-in orders.

### Main Classes

- **Restaurant**: Singleton class that manages the menu (a list of `MenuItem`), the pool of tables (`TablePool`), and provides global access to these resources. It exposes methods to add menu items and display the menu.
- **MenuItem**: Represents a menu product (e.g., burger, pizza) with a name, description, price, and a list of ingredients. Built using the Builder pattern and supports cloning (Prototype pattern) for easy customization.
- **Table**: Represents a physical table in the restaurant, with a unique ID, capacity, and occupancy status. Managed by the `TablePool` for efficient reuse.
- **Order**: Represents a customer order, containing a list of `MenuItem` objects, order type (dine-in, delivery, etc.), and optional table or delivery address. Built using a builder and director for different order types.

### Key Snippets

**Singleton Pattern (Restaurant):**  
_Fits this case because the restaurant must have a single, consistent state for its menu and tables throughout the application. Using Singleton prevents accidental creation of multiple restaurant instances, which could lead to resource conflicts or inconsistent data._

```java
public class Restaurant {
    private static final Restaurant instance = new Restaurant();
    private TablePool tablePool;
    private List<MenuItem> menu;
    private Restaurant() { ... }
    public static Restaurant getInstance() { return instance; }
    // ...
}
```

**Object Pool Pattern (TablePool):**  
_Fits this case because the number of tables in a restaurant is limited and they are reused by different customers. Object Pool ensures that tables are efficiently allocated and released, preventing unnecessary creation and destruction of table objects._

```java
Table table1 = restaurant.getTablePool().acquireTable();
// ... use table1 ...
restaurant.getTablePool().releaseTable(table1);
```

**Builder Pattern (for Order Creation):**  
_Fits this case because orders can have many optional parameters (table, delivery address, items, etc.). Builder makes it easy to construct orders with only the necessary fields, avoiding large constructors with many parameters or a proliferation of overloaded constructors. Each order type has different requirements:_

- `Order` fields: `id`, `List<MenuItem> items`, `OrderType orderType`, `Integer tableId`, `String deliveryAddress`
- `OrderType` enum: `DINE_IN`, `DELIVERY`, `TAKEAWAY`
  - **DINE_IN**: requires a table (tableId must be set)
  - **DELIVERY**: requires a delivery address
  - **TAKEAWAY**: needs neither table nor address

_The builder ensures that only the relevant fields are set for each order type, enforcing correct construction and reducing errors._

```java
DineInOrderBuilder dineInOrderBuilder = new DineInOrderBuilder(table1);
OrderDirector orderDirector = new OrderDirector(dineInOrderBuilder);
orderDirector.constructOrder();
Order dineInOrder = orderDirector.getOrder();
dineInOrder.addItem(burger);
dineInOrder.addItem(cheeseburger);
System.out.println(dineInOrder);
```

**Builder Pattern (MenuItem):**  
_Fits this case because menu items can have many optional ingredients and properties. Builder avoids telescoping constructors and makes it easy to create both simple and complex menu items in a readable, step-by-step way._

```java
MenuItem burger = new MenuItem.MenuItemBuilder()
    .setName("Classic Burger")
    .setDescription("A delicious beef burger with fresh vegetables")
    .setPrice(8.99)
    .addIngredient("Beef Patty")
    .addIngredient("Bun")
    .addIngredient("Lettuce")
    .addIngredient("Tomato")
    .build();
```

**Prototype Pattern (MenuItem):**  
_Fits this case because customers often want to customize existing menu items (e.g., "add cheese to my burger"). Prototype allows you to efficiently create a new item based on an existing one, without rebuilding from scratch or risking changes to the original._

```java
MenuItem cheeseburger = burger.clone();
cheeseburger.setName("Cheeseburger");
cheeseburger.setDescription("Classic burger with melted cheddar cheese");
cheeseburger.addIngredient("Cheddar Cheese");
cheeseburger.setPrice(9.99);
```
